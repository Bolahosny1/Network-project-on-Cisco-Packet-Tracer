# Network-project-on [Cisco-Packet-Tracer]

This repository contains a network project designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical networking concepts and configurations, including device setup, IP addressing, routing, VLANs, and more, in a simulated environment.

## Project Overview

- **Simulation Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Purpose:** To design, configure, and simulate a complex computer network for educational and demonstration purposes.
- **Features:**
  - Multiple routers and switches
  - PC and server nodes
  - VLAN configuration
  - Static and dynamic routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF)
  - DHCP setup
  - Network security (ACLs)
  - Internet simulation

## Repository Structure

- `project-files/` — Contains the Cisco Packet Tracer `.pkt` simulation files.
- `documentation/` — Diagrams, configuration guides, and explanations.
- `configs/` — Text files with CLI configurations for routers and switches.
- `README.md` — Project overview and setup instructions.

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements:**
   - [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) (version 7.x or newer recommended)
   - Basic networking knowledge

2. **Setup:**
   - Clone or download this repository.
   - Open the `.pkt` file(s) in Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. **Usage:**
   - Review the provided network topology diagram in `documentation/`.
   - Follow the configuration steps in `configs/`.
   - Experiment with different network scenarios or expand the project.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Network Topology Design:** How to plan and connect devices in a LAN/WAN environment.
- **IP Addressing:** Assigning static and dynamic IPs using DHCP.
- **Routing:** Implementing RIP/OSPF between routers for inter-network communication.
- **VLANs:** Segmenting the network for improved performance and security.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restricting network traffic for security.
- **Troubleshooting:** Using simulation to practice solving network issues.
